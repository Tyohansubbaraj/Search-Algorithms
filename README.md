# Search-Algorithms

There are 10 search algorithms, one driver file and one file which contains the graph visualization code.

# Modules Used:
1. Columnar - pip install columnar
2. Pyvis - pip install pyvis


# The Search Algorithms:
1. British Musuem Search
2. Depth First Search
3. Breadth First Search
4. Hill Climbing
5. Oracle
6. Branch and Bound
7. Branch and Bound with Extended List
8. Oracle with cost and heuristics
9. Branch and Bound with cost and heuristics
10. A*


# OUTPUT:
1. If the output returned is a singular path, then we represent the path in the graph using Pyvis.
2. If the output returned contains multiple paths, then we represent the paths in tabular form using the columnar module.
